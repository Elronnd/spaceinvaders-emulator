This is an intel 8080 emulator, currently set up to emulate a space invaders machine.  It is based off of the tutorial at http://emulator101.com/.  At the moment, there's a timing problem, a speed problem, an input problem, and a problem where if you quit it with ^C, it doesn't quit.  However, it does show the title screen properly.  All these will be fixed at some point.

You will need a space invaders rom to run the emulator.  These can be found across the internet.  They should be titled invaders.e through invaders.h, and be placed in the 'roam' directory.  For your convenience, the sha512 hashes of the roms I use are reproduced below:
